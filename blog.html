            <span class="text-blue-900">1. Question:</span> What is the
            difference of var, let & const?
          </h2>

          <p class="mt-3">
            <span class="font-bold text-blue-900">Var: </span> There are issues
            associated with variables declared with var, though. That is why it
            was necessary for new ways to declare variables to emerge.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-3">
            <span class="font-bold text-blue-900">Scope of var: </span> Scope
            essentially means where these variables are available for use. var
            declarations are globally scoped or function/locally scoped. The
            scope is global when a var variable is declared outside a function.
            This means that any variable that is declared with var outside a
            function block is available for use in the whole window. var is
            function scoped when it is declared within a function. This means
            that it is available and can be accessed only within that function.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-3">
            <span class="text-blue-900 font-bold">Re-declared:</span> var
            variables can be re-declared and updated
          </p>

          <p class="mt-3">
            <span class="text-blue-900 font-bold">Hoisting of var:</span>
            Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function
            declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code
            execution.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-3">
            <span class="text-blue-900 font-bold">Let: </span>
            let is now preferred for variable declaration. It's no surprise as
            it comes as an improvement to var declarations. It also solves the
            problem with var that we just covered. Let's consider why this is
            so.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-3">
            <span class="text-blue-900 font-bold">let is block scoped: </span>
            A block is a chunk of code bounded by {}. A block lives in curly
            braces. Anything within curly braces is a block. So a variable
            declared in a block with let is only available for use within that
            block.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-3">
            <span class="text-blue-900 font-bold">Re-Declared: </span>
            let can be updated but not re-declared. Just like var, a variable
            declared with let can be updated within its scope. Unlike var, a let
            variable cannot be re-declared within its scope.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-3">
            <span class="text-blue-900 font-bold">Hoisting of let: </span>
            Just like var, let declarations are hoisted to the top. Unlike var
            which is initialized as undefined, the let keyword is not
            initialized. So if you try to use a let variable before declaration,
            you'll get a Reference Error.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-3">
            <span class="text-blue-900 font-bold">Const: </span>
            Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const
            declarations share some similarities with let declarations.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-3">
            <span class="text-blue-900 font-bold"
              >const declarations are block scoped:
            </span>
            Like let declarations, const declarations can only be accessed
            within the block they were declared.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-3">
            <span class="text-blue-900 font-bold">Const re-declared: </span>
            This means that the value of a variable declared with const remains
            the same within its scope. It cannot be updated or re-declared
          </p>

          <p class="mt-3">
            <span class="text-blue-900 font-bold">Hoisting of const: </span>
            Just like let, const declarations are hoisted to the top but are not
            initialized.

        <!-- Arrow function vs regular function -->
        <article class="my-10">
          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold">
            <span class="text-blue-900">2. Question:</span> What Is The
            Difference Between Regular Functions and Arrow Functions?
          </h2>

          <p class="mt-3 font-bold text-blue-900">this value</p>
          <p>
            <span class="font-bold text-blue-900">Regular function: </span>
            Inside of a regular JavaScript function, this value (aka the
            execution context) is dynamic. The dynamic context means that the
            value of this depends on how the function is invoked. In JavaScript,
            there are 4 ways you can invoke a regular function.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="font-bold text-blue-900">Arrow function: </span>
            The behavior of this inside of an arrow function differs
            considerably from the regular function's this behavior. The arrow
            function doesn't define its own execution context. No matter how or
            where being executed, this value inside of an arrow function always
            equals this value from the outer function. In other words, the arrow
            function resolves this lexically.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-3 font-bold text-blue-900">Constructors</p>
          <p>
            <span class="font-bold text-blue-900">Regular function: </span>
            As seen in the previous section, the regular function can easily
            construct objects.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="font-bold text-blue-900">Arrow function: </span>
            A consequence of this resolved lexically is that an arrow function
            cannot be used as a constructor.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-3 font-bold text-blue-900">arguments object</p>
          <p>
            <span class="font-bold text-blue-900">Regular function: </span>
            Inside the body of a regular function, arguments is a special
            array-like object containing the list of arguments with which the
            function has been invoked.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="font-bold text-blue-900">Arrow function: </span>
            On the other side, no arguments special keyword is defined inside an
            arrow function. Again (same as with this value), the arguments
            object is resolved lexically: the arrow function accesses arguments
            from the outer function.

        <!-- why template string use -->
        <article>
          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold">
            <span class="text-blue-900">3. Question:</span> What are template
            strings?
          </h2>

          <p class="mt-3">
            Template literals are literals delimited with backtick (`)
            characters, allowing for multi-line strings, for string
            interpolation with embedded expressions, and for special constructs
            called tagged templates. Template literals are sometimes informally
            called template strings, because they are used most commonly for
            string interpolation (to create strings by doing substitution of
            placeholders). However, a tagged template literal may not result in
            a string; it can be used with a custom tag function to perform
            whatever operations you want on the different parts of the template
            literal.
